# Cisco CCNP + Enterprise Systems & Python Automation

This is my current technical focus: working toward Cisco CCNP certification while expanding deeper into enterprise systems architecture and advanced Python automation. The CCNP track is more than an exam goal—it's a structured path aligning with the challenges I'm solving through my ongoing **CrimsonPing** project, which involves scripting automated workflows and monitoring solutions across multi-site networks.

## Focus Areas

- **Enterprise Routing and Switching**  
  Developing deep understanding of scalable routing protocols (OSPF, BGP, EIGRP) and switching technologies (STP, VLANs, EtherChannel) that underpin high-availability environments.

- **Secure and Resilient Network Design**  
  Applying CCNP-level security principles to design fault-tolerant and encrypted network topologies suitable for hybrid infrastructures.

- **Python Engine Scripting (CrimsonPing)**  
  Leveraging Python to build custom modules that interface with monitoring endpoints, parse telemetry data, and trigger intelligent alerts—aimed at reducing ticket noise and improving root-cause visibility.

- **Automation Across Systems**  
  Using Python to glue together cloud APIs, SNMP agents, and local probes within enterprise Windows and Linux environments.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Cisco IOS / NX-OS**
- **Python 3.x / asyncio / FastAPI / rich / Jinja2**
- **Routing Protocols**: OSPF, BGP, EIGRP
- **Monitoring APIs**: Domotz, ConnectWise, SNMP
- **Infrastructure**: VLANs, LACP, ACLs, NAT/PAT
- **Automation Stack**: Bash, PowerShell, Scheduled Tasks, Azure Functions (future)

## Timeline & Intent

- **Now → 2025**: Active CCNP prep with labs, infrastructure modeling, and CrimsonPing development.
- **Late 2025 → Jan 2026**: Finalize certification path, integrate network layer intelligence into CrimsonPing's engine.
- **Goal**: Achieve CCNP by **January 2026**, with a full-stack automation layer that reflects that capability.

## Why This Matters

In a world of noisy dashboards and reactive IT, the convergence of **network engineering** and **custom automation** is key. This endeavor isn’t about passing an exam—it's about building **practical mastery** that feeds directly into the tools and systems I deploy every day. CrimsonPing is the proving ground.
