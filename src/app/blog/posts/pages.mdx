## Why Use Cloudflare as an API Gateway?

Cloudflare is widely known for CDN and DDoS protection, but it has grown into a powerful **edge-layer platform** capable of acting as your **API gateway**â€”no expensive tooling or vendor lock-in required.

I use it to:
- Protect internal and public APIs
- Implement zero-trust policies
- Cache dynamic responses
- Create rate limits and firewall rules at the edge

## Benefits Over Traditional API Gateways

###  Global Edge Network  
APIs routed through Cloudflare benefit from their global network, reducing latency and ensuring fast response times regardless of user location.

###  Security by Default  
- **Bot protection**
- **Geo-blocking**
- **mTLS and WAF rules**
- **IP filtering**

All without managing a complex infrastructure stack.

###  Developer-Friendly Workflows  
Cloudflare Workers and Pages allow me to:
- Deploy JavaScript logic at the edge
- Rewrite or route requests conditionally
- Serve fallback data even when the origin is down

## How I Use It

I've set up a Cloudflare zone to manage all traffic to `api.mydomain.com`. My config looks like this:

-  **Page Rules**: Forward `/v1/*` to internal services
-  **Cache Rules**: Cache certain read-heavy endpoints like `/public/articles`
-  **Workers**: Sanitize inputs and add rate limiting before it hits my backend
-  **Access Control**: Token validation using `cf-access` headers

---

## Sample Use Case

Here's a simple Worker to proxy and cache an external API:

```js
addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)
  const target = `https://thirdpartyapi.com${url.pathname}`
  
  const response = await fetch(target, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` }
  })

  return new Response(await response.text(), {
    headers: { "Cache-Control": "s-maxage=3600" }
  })
}
