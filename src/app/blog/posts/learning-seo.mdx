## Building for Visibility

When I started building my portfolio with Magic Portfolio, I was mostly focused on performance, design, and clean code. But over time, I realized: **great design doesn’t matter if no one can find it**.

That's where SEO came in—not as an afterthought, but as an intentional part of the build.

## Key Lessons I’ve Learned

###  Metadata Matters
Setting a unique `title`, `description`, and `image` for every page (via frontmatter or Next.js metadata APIs) makes a huge difference—not only for search engines, but for link previews and accessibility.

###  Mobile-First is SEO-First
Google heavily prioritizes **mobile performance and responsiveness**. Magic Portfolio’s layout system and image optimization with `SmartImage` helped me pass Core Web Vitals consistently.

###  Semantic HTML Still Wins
Using proper heading levels (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), meaningful alt text, and `<nav>`/`<article>`/`<main>` landmarks has improved both my Lighthouse scores and my discoverability.

## Technical SEO Enhancements

Here’s what I implemented under the hood:

- **Open Graph tags** for social media previews.
- **Canonical URLs** to avoid duplicate content penalties.
- **Sitemap generation** for indexing clarity.
- **Robots.txt** to guide crawlers.
- **Dynamic OG image generation** per post (powered by Vercel).

## SEO is Ongoing

The biggest lesson? **SEO isn’t one and done.** It’s an evolving process:

- I check Google Search Console regularly.
- I test changes with Lighthouse and SEMrush.
- I keep performance high with lightweight scripts and compressed images.

## Final Thoughts

SEO is part art, part science. And as a developer, I now treat it like any other part of my stack—**testable, measurable, and essential**.
