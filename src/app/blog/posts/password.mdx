## A New CMS, a New Mindset

I've worked with modern web stacks like Next.js, headless CMS platforms like Sanity and Strapi, and custom admin panels built from scratch. But recently, I decided to spend some time digging into **Drupal**—a platform I had long considered outdated or overly complex.

What I found was both surprising and rewarding.

## The Strength of Structure

Drupal is extremely opinionated—in a good way. Its content architecture is built around:
- **Nodes** (content)
- **Taxonomies** (classification)
- **Blocks and Views** (rendering)
- **User roles and permissions**

Unlike many headless or flat-file CMS tools, Drupal comes with a **robust access control system** and content workflows out of the box.

---

## The Learning Curve

Here's what took the most time to adapt to:

- **Terminology**: "Nodes," "Bundles," "Entities"—everything has a name and abstraction.
- **Theming system**: It's not as flexible as JSX or Tailwind at first glance.
- **Backend-first development**: Much of your structure is defined in the admin UI before you touch code.

Once I embraced that it's a different way of thinking—almost like configuring an ERP—I began to appreciate its power.

## Where It Shines

I would reach for Drupal in cases like:
- Complex publishing workflows with editorial review
- Government or education sites needing granular permissions
- Multilingual sites with deep content trees
- Heavy use of taxonomies, tagging, and hierarchical content

---

## Would I Use It Again?

Yes—but selectively. For portfolio projects or fast-moving startups, I'd likely still prefer something like Next.js + CMS API. But for **enterprise-grade, content-heavy applications**, Drupal brings a level of maturity and configurability that's hard to match.
