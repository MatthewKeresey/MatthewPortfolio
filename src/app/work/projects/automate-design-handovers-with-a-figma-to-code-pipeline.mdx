## Why Red Hat Again?

After years of working in environments dominated by **Ubuntu** and **Windows**, I recently found myself getting back into **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**—and it felt like rediscovering an old, battle-tested toolbelt with a more enterprise edge.

This post compares my experience working across the three operating systems as a developer and systems engineer, especially in projects focused on automation, CI/CD, and design system pipelines.

##  Development Workflow Comparison

| Feature                         | **Red Hat (RHEL/CentOS)**       | **Ubuntu (Debian-based)**        | **Windows 11**                    |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Package Manager                 | `dnf` (previously `yum`)         | `apt`                             | Winget / Chocolatey (3rd party)   |
| Systemd & Services              | Yes                              | Yes                              | No native systemd, uses SCM       |
| Dev Tools Availability          | Enterprise-grade, slower updates | Bleeding-edge, broader community | VS Code & WSL fill gaps           |
| SELinux & Security              | SELinux (enforced)               | AppArmor (lighter)               | Antivirus-centric, Group Policy   |
| Kernel Customization            | High, especially for VMs         | High                              | Low unless using Hyper-V/WSL      |
| Container Tooling               | Podman + Docker compatible       | Docker native                    | Docker Desktop (via WSL)          |

##  Real Project Reflections

### Red Hat for Infrastructure-Heavy Projects

Red Hat shines in **enterprise automation** and **security-sensitive deployments**. When building CI pipelines for design handoff tools or provisioning servers for internal design systems:
- SELinux + systemd = predictable, locked-down services
- Podman (Docker alternative) = containerized build workflows with fewer attack vectors
- GitHub Actions runners can be deployed and managed with **Ansible** or **Red Hat Satellite**

Ideal for regulated environments or when paired with tools like OpenShift.

### Ubuntu for Developer Agility

For fast-moving development—especially when prototyping tools like:
- Figma-to-React pipelines
- JS build systems
- SSGs (Next.js, Astro, etc.)

Ubuntu is unbeatable. You'll get faster package updates, broader community support, and plug-and-play compatibility with tools like Node, pnpm, and Firebase CLI. It's my go-to for:
- Startup MVPs
- Cloud server automation (especially on DigitalOcean or GCP)
- Headless CMS deployments

### Windows for Design + Dev Hybrid Workflows

Windows, particularly with **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)**, is surprisingly powerful for front-end and DevOps hybrid workflows. In projects involving Figma, Adobe XD, and browser testing:
- VS Code + WSL = smooth terminal dev inside Windows UI
- Powershell + GitHub CLI = flexible automation
- Great if your stack includes Microsoft 365, OneDrive, or Teams integrations

But it still falls short in performance for pure back-end Linux-native tooling (e.g., systemd sockets, Linux ACLs).

##  Key Takeaways

- **Red Hat**: Use it when reliability, traceability, and hardened systems matter most. It's not about speed—it's about **stability at scale**.
- **Ubuntu**: Great for developers who need to move quickly, customize heavily, and live on the bleeding edge.
- **Windows**: Ideal for hybrid roles (design/PM/dev), but still best paired with WSL2 or cloud-hosted dev containers.

## Final Thought

Getting back into Red Hat reminded me of how much tooling and thinking is shaped by your OS. It also made me appreciate how much **Red Hat, Ubuntu, and Windows can co-exist**, especially in today's containerized, multi-cloud world.
