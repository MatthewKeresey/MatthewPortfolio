## Why This Debate Still Matters

In nearly every full-stack project I work on, there's a moment where the question arises: **Should we use REST or GraphQL?**

Both are valid tools, but they come with different philosophies and trade-offs. Here's what I've learned from building APIs with both, and when I choose one over the other.

---

## REST: The Classic Workhorse

REST APIs are built around **resources** and **HTTP verbs** (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`). Each endpoint represents a single object or collection.

###  Strengths:
- Simpler caching with HTTP
- Easier for public APIs and straightforward CRUD apps
- Widely supported by frameworks, tools, and devs
- Easier logging and debugging

###  Trade-offs:
- Over-fetching or under-fetching data
- Multiple round-trips for nested relationships
- Strict versioning requirements

---

## GraphQL: The Flexible Query Layer

GraphQL allows the client to **ask for exactly what it needs**. It's schema-driven, introspective, and works via a single HTTP endpoint.

###  Strengths:
- One request can retrieve deeply nested data
- Typed schema = self-documenting API
- Ideal for frontend-heavy apps or mobile clients
- Eases evolution with no need for versioning

###  Trade-offs:
- Complex to cache without tools like Apollo or Relay
- Requires more setup and tooling
- Potential for unoptimized queries from the client
- Difficult to enforce RBAC without extra guardrails

## When I Use Each

| Use Case                               | My Pick        |
|----------------------------------------|----------------|
| Simple CRUD or public API              | REST           |
| Complex relationships (e.g. blogs, CMS)| GraphQL        |
| Mobile apps with tight bandwidth needs | GraphQL        |
| Integration with 3rd-party consumers   | REST (easier to document and consume) |
| Real-time or hybrid with Subscriptions | GraphQL + WebSockets |
| Fast prototyping or MVPs               | REST or Supabase (prebuilt) |

---

## Final Thoughts

- REST is stable, reliable, and ubiquitous. It's not going away.
- GraphQL is powerful for dynamic UIs and internal tools with evolving schemas.
- I treat GraphQL more like a **query language over my services**, while REST is the **interface to individual objects**.

Sometimes, the best answer is: **use both**. I've worked on projects that use REST for public endpoints and GraphQL internally for admin dashboards.
