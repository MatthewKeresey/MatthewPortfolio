## A Challenge Beyond the Keyboard

Running a marathon was never on my radar until last year. I’ve always tackled mental endurance—long coding sessions, late-night deployments, debugging edge cases—but physical endurance? That was new territory.

The idea started as a casual challenge, but quickly became a goal I couldn’t ignore.

## Training Through Discipline

Just like learning a new framework or building out an automation pipeline, training demanded structure. I applied what I know best: systems thinking.

- **Schedule**: 4 runs a week, gradually increasing distance.
- **Metrics**: I tracked everything—pace, heart rate, and recovery.
- **Mindset**: There were days I didn’t want to lace up my shoes. But I did anyway.

The experience reminded me of debugging stubborn code: consistency always leads to progress.

## Race Day

The day of the race was electric. Surrounded by thousands of strangers, all with their own reasons for being there, I felt strangely at home.

There were moments I wanted to stop, but just like pushing a project past the final bug, I kept going.

**Time: 4:28:37**

Not my fastest pace, but I crossed the line—something I once thought impossible.

## Lessons from the Road

What I learned from 26.2 miles:
- **Consistency > Intensity** — one step at a time.
- **Rest is part of progress** — something many of us overlook in tech.
- **Your limit is further than you think** — in running and in code.

## Looking Ahead

Will I run another one? Probably. But more importantly, I’ve found a new appreciation for pushing boundaries—physical, mental, and professional.

Let me know if you'd like to follow along as I build out a running tracker app using Next.js, Supabase, and Once UI.
