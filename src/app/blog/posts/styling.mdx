## What Is Cursor AI?

Cursor AI is a next-gen coding assistant built into an IDE-like experience. Think Copilot meets VS Code, with a focus on **pair programming, refactoring, and AI-assisted file navigation**. I've been using it on and off for a few months, and here's what I think.

## Where It Shines 

###  Contextual Awareness

Cursor doesn't just complete code like Copilotâ€”it **understands your project**. I can ask it:
> "Refactor this function to use async/await"  
> "Where is this component used?"  
> "Summarize what this file does"

The results are often surprisingly accurate, even in larger projects.

### ðŸ”§ Codebase Navigation and Modification

One standout feature is **multi-file awareness**. I can highlight a block and say "extract this into a hook," and it actually creates the new file and inserts the import in the original. That kind of fluid editing feels like the future.

###  Inline Q&A

Its ability to answer questions about libraries, dependencies, or explain TypeScript errors in-line is a huge time-saver. It's more like talking to a senior engineer than using Stack Overflow.

---

## Where It Falls Short 

- **Heavy compute lag** at times, especially in large projects with many files.
- It occasionally **hallucinates changes**â€”e.g., suggesting files that don't exist or ignoring existing exports.
- The **pricing model** may not fit solo developers or students compared to Copilot.

And while the chat-like interface is great for some tasks, it can feel like overkill for simple completions or boilerplate.

---

## How I Use It

- Refactoring older code into hooks or components
- Writing documentation inline (it helps format and explain really well)
- Automating repetitive updates across files
- Experimenting with architectural changes in branches before I commit anything

## Final Thoughts

Cursor AI is one of the most promising tools I've used recently. It's not flawlessâ€”but its potential is clear. It takes the idea of AI pair programming and **anchors it inside your real workflow**, rather than just inside a textbox.

If you're building anything serious in JavaScript, TypeScript, or Reactâ€”it's worth a trial run.

Would you like me to compare Cursor AI to GitHub Copilot or Codeium in a future post?
