## Why LeetCode?

As a systems engineer working closely with infrastructure, automation, and full-stack tools, I find it essential to keep my problem-solving muscles strong. LeetCode offers a focused way to do this, whether it’s revisiting data structures, practicing dynamic programming, or writing optimized solutions under constraints.

## What I'm Focusing On

I’ve been working on a structured schedule that targets:
- **Daily problem solving** (at least one per day).
- **Pattern recognition**, like sliding windows, prefix sums, and backtracking.
- **Performance tuning**, writing clean, readable, and efficient code in Python and JavaScript.

## Recent Wins

Some recent challenges I've particularly enjoyed:
- Solved a binary tree recursion problem using a bottom-up DFS approach.
- Optimized a sliding window problem down from O(n²) to O(n).
- Used prefix sum arrays to reduce nested loops in subarray range problems.

These have helped me reinforce fundamentals while gaining new tricks.

## Looking Ahead

Next, I’m focusing on:
- **System design problems** to complement my coding knowledge.
- Practicing **mock interview simulations**.
- Sharing walkthroughs for selected LeetCode solutions on my portfolio.

## Closing Thoughts

Whether you're interviewing, freelancing, or deep into architecture, LeetCode is a solid gym for your technical thinking. For me, it’s a way to keep pace with the evolving landscape of AI and engineering.
